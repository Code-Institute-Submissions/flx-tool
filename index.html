                    In order to be eligible for an Irish driving licence you have to be a resident in Ireland and have the right to remain
                    in Ireland. You also need to be able to prove your identity and PPSN. The following example should give you a good idea of
                    what an applicant can submit to prove all this.
                    <h3>Example Applicant</h3>
                    <ol class="mb-2">
                        <li>
                            <strong>Photo ID:</strong> EU Passport
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>PPSN Proof:</strong> Letter from Revenue
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Address Proof:</strong> Irish Bank Statement which is dated within 6 months of the application
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Residency Entitlement:</strong> EU Passport
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    You may have noticed, this example shows that the applicant submitted an EU passport to satisfy both identification and residency requirements.
                    This is because EU citizens are entitled to remain in Ireland.

                <p>
                    Finding out if your licence is eligible is simple. First you need to ensure that your country
                    exchanges with Ireland.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All EU member states have a licence exchange agreement. This means that if you hold a licence from
                    Poland, you can exchange it in Ireland because both countries are in the EU.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Recognised states from outside of the EU such as Australia & Japan, can also exchange.

                <p>
                    <strong>Please note that if your licence is from a recognised state, you will need to provide an

                    If your licence has a group 2 category on it, such as a C or D licence category. You will need a
                    Medical Report from your doctor in order to exchange. However, if you don't want to exchange these
                    categories you can submit a Declaration to Surrender Categories form. This way you can exchange just
                    your group 1 categories which include; motorcycles, cars, cars with trailers and tractors.

                    When you arrive, please check in with the friendly staff member at the front entrance as they will
                    guide you to join the queue. Please leave any queries for the Verification Officer, this is the
                    person validating your application in the booth.
                </p>

                    Once you're in the booth, you'll be asked to submit your application form and your licence. The
                    Verification Officer will check everything for you to ensure your application passes smoothly and
                    without issue. They may ask to see additional documentation that you have brought, such as proof of
                    address, eyesight report etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your photos will be taken in the booth once the Verification Officer is happy with all the
                    documentation you provided. There is no need to bring your own photographs as they cannot be used.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Payment will also be taken at this point. Foreign licence exchange usually costs €55, however if the
                    applicant is over 70 years of age. The application is taken free of charge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please be advised that currently only card payments are acceptable. No cash.

                <p>
                    Please read some of the most common issues that applicants run into. This can save you a trip to the
                    NDLS as you'll need a new appointment if you run into them yourself.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Make sure you have booked your appointment successfuly. If you have not received a text message
                        or an email confirming your appointment you likely didn't submit your request correctly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Ensure that your doctor/optician has filled in all the required fields on your report. Small
                        mistakes like dating your report for the year 2020 instead of 2021 or entering in today's date
                        instead of your date of birth will result in your application being rejected as only the issuing
                        party can alter your report.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your licence is lost you will need to bring alternative photo ID and have a Garda Declaration
                        form to submit.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If you have a licence from a country like New Zealand or Canada where it is not clear whether
                        you passed your test for an automatic/manual car, you will need a Letter of Entitlement from the
                        issuing driving authority.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        If your licence is not in English, you will need a letter of entitlement along with a certified
                        translation to submit as part of your application.
                    </li>
