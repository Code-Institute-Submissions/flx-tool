Welcome JakubMrowicki,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

# 1: Overview

The NDLS is forced to serve customers on an appointment only basis due to COVID-19 restrictions. This has heavily affected customer satisfaction ratings as well as company revenue.


The primary concern is foreign driving licence exchange appointments as they are usually first time customers and unfamiliar with the NDLS. These applications are more complex in comparison to standard Irish licence applications, therefore they have a considerably lower success rate.

The low success rate is causing frustration for the customer due to the applicant having to rebook another appointment which can take weeks. In addition to this, the NDLS can only charge a fee for successful applications, hence the revenue loss.

>> We must __improve the success rate__ for this type of application. To achieve this, we should __offer easy to understand guidance__ for customers that will help to __alleviate the commmon issues__ that arise when exchanging a foreign licence.

# 2: Description

The NDLS Foreign Licence Exchange Tool, or simply FLX is an easy online tool designed to guide customers through their application process. This tool exists in order to improve overall customer satisfaction and boost revenue.
