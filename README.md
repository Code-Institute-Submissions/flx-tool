# 1: Overview

The NDLS is forced to serve customers on an appointment only basis due to COVID-19 restrictions. This has heavily affected customer satisfaction ratings as well as company revenue.


The primary concern is foreign driving licence exchange appointments as they are usually first time customers and unfamiliar with the NDLS. These applications are more complex in comparison to standard Irish licence applications, therefore they have a considerably lower success rate.

The low success rate is causing frustration for the customer due to the applicant having to rebook another appointment which can take weeks. In addition to this, the NDLS can only charge a fee for successful applications, hence the revenue loss.

> We must __improve the success rate__ for this type of application. To achieve this, we should __offer easy to understand guidance__ for customers that will help to __alleviate the commmon issues__ that arise when exchanging a foreign licence.

# 2: Description

The NDLS Foreign Licence Exchange Tool, or simply FLX is an easy online tool designed to guide customers through their application process. This tool exists in order to improve overall customer satisfaction and boost revenue.

# 4: User Experience(UX)
## Strategy Plane
* What is the purpose of this application?
    * The purpose of this application is to __aid customers__ who come to __exchange their foreign licence__ at the NDLS.
    * Most of the time, __customers who are exchanging a licence have never visited our service before.__ This results in a __high rejection rate due to uninformed customers__ who don’t bring all the __required documentation.__
    * By informing the customer before they apply, __user experience overall benefits__ and the __company earns their fee__ for the successful application.
* Who is the user?
    * Adult user.
    * Due to the nature of the application, it is likely that the applicant has __limited English__. It would help to __use simple and clear language__ throughout the content.
    * Usually, the user is preparing for their __very first visit__ to the NDLS.
* Why is the content relevant?
    * By consuming the easily digestible content, the requirements will be clear to the user and thus __helping the user achieve their end goal.__
    * Frequently asked questions will be answered clearly.
* Business goals?
    * Increase the success rate of applicants.
    * This is important because there is a __finite number of appointments__ per day and only successful applicants are charged a fee. Meaning that each rejected application is a loss for the business.
* Value for the user?
    * __Save time__ by avoiding a wasted trip due to submitting insufficient documentation.
    * __Make it convenient for the user__, save them from digging through the official website which is designed to cater to all applicants.
